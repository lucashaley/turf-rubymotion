# Turf!

## Turf is an iOS game, in which you and your friends run around in the real world to claim territory in the virtual, and the most area claimed wins. I've been using the term 'IRLRTS' -- in real life real-time strategy.

The game is currently developed using RubyMotion, a bunch of gems and cocoapods, and Firebase.
